# Information Retrieval notes
Simple notes by a simple mind.

DISCLAIMERS:
1) I have a terrible handwriting, and the notes are taken with a tablet. Please contact me in case of doubts; I'll try to write better
2) I didn't follow the course, and relied on the teacher's notes only; therefore I may have missed or mis-interpreted some things.
3) Always double check using the teacher's notes here http://didawiki.di.unipi.it/doku.php/magistraleinformatica/ir/ir19/start
4) There is no real order (apart for the notes in the folders), therefore you should use the link above also for the syllabus
